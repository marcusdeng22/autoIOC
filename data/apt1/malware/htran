When APT1 attackers are not using WEBC2, they require a “command and control” (C2) user interface so they can
issue commands to the backdoor. This interface sometimes runs on their personal attack system, which is typically
in Shanghai. In these instances, when a victim backdoor makes contact with a hop, the communications need to be
forwarded from the hop to the intruder’s Shanghai system so the backdoor can talk to the C2 server software. We have
observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the publicly available “HUC Packet Transmit Tool”
or HTRAN on a hop. As always, keep in mind that these uses are confirmed uses, and likely represent only a small
fraction of APT1’s total activity.
The HTRAN utility is merely a middle-man, facilitating connections between the victim and the attacker who is using
the hop point
